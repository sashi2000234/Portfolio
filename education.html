	<h3 id="StockPred">Final Year Project - B.Tech </h3>
	<h3>STock Market Prediction Through AI Approach </h3>
	<p > <span class="image left"><img src="images/stocks.png" alt="" /></span >During my final year at Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation, I took on a challenging project that perfectly aligned with my interest in artificial intelligence and its applications in the financial market. Titled "Prediction of Wall Street Through AI Approach", this project was an endeavor to develop an advanced solution for stock market forecasting. Our research was centered around various AI methodologies, including machine learning and deep learning, with a specific focus on predicting stock 'Close Prices'.

		In my role, I immersed myself in comprehensive data analysis and the testing of multiple algorithms, leveraging eight years of stock market data. We evaluated several predictive models such as ARIMA, Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, LSTM, and SVM Regressor. A key highlight of our findings was the recognition of LSTM's superiority in forecasting accuracy. For instance, while the baseline models provided an initial prediction accuracy of around 60%, the application of LSTM models pushed this number to over 80%, marking a significant 20% improvement in prediction precision.
		
		</p>
	<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/StockAnalysis1.jpg" alt="" /></span>Building on our research, I led the creation of a full-stack website that not only showcased our predictive models but also served as a practical tool for investors, displaying predicted stock prices of selected companies. Balancing the technical and financial aspects of this project was challenging, especially in maintaining the accuracy and reliability of our predictions within the volatile stock market. Notably, our models achieved a 16% reduction in error rates compared to traditional forecasting methods, which was a testament to our success in enhancing predictive reliability.

		This project was not just a capstone to my academic learning; it was a venture into applying my AI and web development skills to a real-world challenge. It underscored the importance of an interdisciplinary approach and perseverance in problem-solving. These experiences have shaped my professional outlook, instilling a passion for transforming theoretical knowledge into impactful technological solutions.</p>

		<h3 id="SWM">FRAUD DETECTION USING GRAPH DATABASES AND MACHINE LEARNING</h3>
	
	<p > <span class="image left"><img src="images/SWMP.png" alt="" /></span >In an era where online transactions are proliferating, our team set out to address the growing concern of banking fraud. We embarked on a project utilizing the synthetic BankSim dataset to simulate real-world bank transactions, focusing on detecting fraudulent activities. Our approach combined the power of machine learning with the insights offered by graph databases, specifically employing Neo4j to map complex transaction networks.

		The challenge was to create a model capable of distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions with high accuracy. We tackled this by preprocessing the BankSim dataset to extract key features like customer details, transaction amounts, and merchant information. Machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines and Random Forests, were then trained on these features. A significant part of our strategy involved using graph database technology to reveal intricate connections in transaction data, thereby enhancing our model's predictive capabilities.
		
		The project's success was marked by a significant improvement in the accuracy of fraud detection, surpassing traditional methods. We navigated challenges such as the dataset's imbalance and the complexities of integrating a graph database with machine learning techniques. Through this experience, we gained valuable insights into advanced data analysis and the potential of combining various technologies for practical applications.
		
		This project holds particular relevance for financial institutions seeking efficient and precise fraud detection methods. Our work demonstrates a novel way of leveraging modern technologies to strengthen fraud detection systems, contributing substantially to the field of financial security. This endeavor not only achieved high accuracy in identifying fraudulent transactions but also paved the way for future innovations in combating financial fraud.
